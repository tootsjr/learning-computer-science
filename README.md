# Computer Science

A repository documenting my progression through computer science fundamentals, focusing on low-level systems and modern web architecture.

## Overview

This project serves as a centralized archive for academic exercises, personal projects, and experiments in memory management and systems design.

## Technical Environment

* **Editor:** Neovim (NvChad)
* **Terminal:** WezTerm
* **Font:** FantasqueSansM Nerd Font
* **Shell:** Starship
* **Compiler:** Clang / GCC (Apple Silicon)

## Core Domains

### C & C++
Focusing on manual memory management, pointer arithmetic, and the transition from procedural to object-oriented programming. Includes CLI tools and algorithmic implementations.

### Web Architecture
Implementing modern front-ends using React and JSX, with a focus on component architecture and clean state management.

## Project Structure

* `/C` — Procedural programming and core logic.
* `/C++` — OOP, templates, and systems experiments.
* `/Projects` — Finished utilities and CLI applications.
